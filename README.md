# 🏦 Banking System (C++)

A simple console-based Banking System developed using C++ to simulate core banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing/withdrawing money, checking balance, and deleting accounts.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project implements a basic banking system using C++ with features like account creation, transactions (deposit and withdrawal), balance inquiry, and account management. It's designed as a command-line application for practicing file handling, classes, and object-oriented programming in C++.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧾 Create New Bank Accounts  
- 💰 Deposit Money  
- 💸 Withdraw Money  
- 📊 Check Balance  
- 🗃️ View All Account Details  
- ❌ Delete Existing Accounts  
- 💾 Persistent data storage using file handling (binary/text files)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User is presented with a menu** with options to perform banking operations.
2. Each user account contains:
   - Account Number
   - Holder’s Name
   - Account Type (Savings/Current)
   - Balance
3. The data is stored persistently using file I/O operations (`fstream` in C++).
4. Input validation ensures smooth and error-free operation of the program.

## 💡 Sample Menu Options

1. Create New Account
2. Deposit Amount
3. Withdraw Amount
4. Balance Enquiry
5. All Account Holder List
6. Close an Account
7. Exit


## 📂 Resource List
1. C++ – Core language used

2. G++ Compiler – For compiling the code

3. File Handling (fstream) – To store user data persistently

4. OOP Concepts – For handling account data using classes

5. Command Line Interface (CLI) – Text-based user interaction

## 🖐️🖐️ Acknowledgement

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **CodeAlpha** for providing me the opportunity to work on this project as part of their internship program.

This Banking System project was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to apply core concepts of **C++ programming**, including **object-oriented design** and **file handling**, in building a real-world simulation.

This project marks a significant step in my journey toward mastering software development and problem-solving.

**Developed with dedication by [Mohana Sri Premnath] under the guidance of CodeAlpha.**
